    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp. sesame oil</li>
        <li>8 chicken wings</li>
        <li>2 tsp bonito soup stock </li>
        <li>5 cups of water</li>
        <li>2 tsp of minced ginger</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>0.25 cups sake</li>
        <li>2 tbsp gelatin</li>
        <li>1 cup white rice</li>
        <li>2 green onions</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add sesame oil to a pan and heat to medium. Fry the chicken wings for 10-15 minutes, or until golden brown. Save the chicken residue in the pan.</li>
        <li>Add water and soup stock to a pot and heat to a boil. Add the chicken and turn the broth down to medium low.
        </li>
        <li>Add the ginger, soy sauce, sake, and sugar to the chicken pan. Stir all of these ingredients with a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Pour everything from the pan into the Broth. Simmer on medium-low for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Take the broth off the heat and let it sit for a few minutes. If there is a layer of fat on the top, take it off. Take the chicken wings out and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Add the gelatine to 1/2 of water and let bloom for 5 minutes. Mix the gelatine into the water until fully dissolved. Add the gelatine mix to the broth mix.</li>
        <li>Grease a tray with butter. Add the broth. Cover with cling wrap, put in the fridge and and let solidify for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Separate the chicken from the bone and skin. Add the chicken to the rice, unless you want the recipe to be exactly like in Food Wars.</li>
        <li>Take the gelatin broth out of the fridge and Cut small cubes of broth gelatin.</li>
        <li>Scramble eggs. Add eggs and chopped green onions to rice. Add the aspic (meat broth jelly). Watch the cubes melt and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>

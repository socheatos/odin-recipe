    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Japanese Hollandaise</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>150g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1-2 tsp yuzu or lemon juice</li>
        <li>1-2 tsp soy sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Tonkatsu</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork loin or scoth fillet</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>AP flour</li>
        <li>1-2 large eggs</li>
        <li>Panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Tempura Eggs</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh large eggs</li>
        <li>125g AP or cake flour</li>
        <li>125g ice cold water</li>
        <li>5g cornflour</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>To serve</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>White rice</li>
        <li>Konbu (cooked with rice)</li>
        <li>Shiso leaves (thai basil substitute)</li>
        <li>Finely sliced spring onions or garlic chive</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Rice</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash your rice 3-4 times to remove excess starch. Use your method of choice to cook the rice, adding in 2g of konbu into the uncooked rice for each portion you're cooking.</li>
        <li>When the rice is cooked, remove the konbu and finely dice into small pieces, reserving to one side.</li>
        <li>Finely slice or dice shiso leaves or relevant herb substitute. You'll need approximately 1tbsp per portion, or to taste. Reserve to one side.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Japanese Hollandaise</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. In another saucepan, heat 2 cups of water over medium heat until simmering.
        </li>
        <li>Place a heatproof bowl over the pan of simmering water, ensuring the water isn't touching the base of the bowl. Add the egg yolks and 2tsp of yuzu or lemon juice. Whisk to combine until homogenous, and the yolks become slightly thicker and paler.</li>
        <li>Slowly drizzle the melted butter into egg yolks while constantly whisking. When the butter is all added, continue to whisk and cook over the simmering water for 5-10 minutes or until the sauce has thickened to your liking.</li>
        <li> If not using immediately, store in a heat-retaining container (i.e. a thermos) until required.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Tempura Poached Eggs</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a large saucepan filled with water over medium heat until almost simmering. Add 1tbsp of white wine vinegar, stirring to distribute.</li>
        <li>Crack a large egg into a bowl. When the water is almost simmering, stir the water in a circular motion to make a strong vortex in the centre of the pan. Carefully pour your egg into the spinning vortex and allow the water to wrap the egg whites around the yolk.</li>
        <li>Drop the heat to low and cook for 6 to 7 minutes or until whites have set but the yolk is still soft.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove eggs from water with a slotted spoon, and place on paper towel to dry.</li>
        <li>Make tempura batter by sifting together the flour and cornflour. Add the water and mix to fully combine, adding more water if the batter is too thick (it should be quite thin).</li>
        <li>Heat a saucepan with oil to 180C. Cover the poached eggs in the batter and fry for 2-3 minutes or until lightly golden and crisp.</li>
        <li>Drain on paper towel to remove excess oil</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Tonkatsu</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Tenderise pork, season both sides with salt and allow to rest for 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Coat the pork thoroughly in flour and then the egg. Repeat flour and egg coating before packing on panko breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Heat 1cm worth of oil in a high-walled frying pan over medium-high heat. Test for oil heat by dropping in a piece of panko, it should bubble immediately. Fry for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Remove from oil and lean the tonkatsu upright in a frying basket to drain excess oil.</li>
        <li>Rest for 5 minutes before using a sharp knife to cut into slices.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Assembly</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine a portion of white rice with the reserved diced konbu and herbs.</li>
        <li>Place the sliced tonkatsu over the rice.
        </li>
        <li>Place a tempura egg on top of the tonkatsu, glaze over with hollandaise sauce and garnish with finely sliced spring onions.</li>
    </ol>
